# fusionjs

This is a javascript library I've been writing in bits and pieces over the years.
Basically, whenever I find myself writing the same piece of code over and over again I throw it into this file for the sake of convenience.
I am fully aware that a lot of what is done in this library already exists (and is probably better implemented) in things like
jQuery, etc.  But this is mine.  So it might be useless, but it's mine.
